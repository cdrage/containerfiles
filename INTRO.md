# Dockerfiles
Welcome! This is a list of Dockerfiles that I use. Some are ones that I have created, other's have been modified for my usage.

Each container is automatically built and pushed to [https://hub.docker.com/r/cdrage/](https://hub.docker.com/r/cdrage/) upon each commit.

Otherwise, you may also `git clone https://github.com/cdrage/dockerfiles` and build it yourself.

Below is a general overview (with instructions) on each Docker container I use. This is automatically generated from the comments that I have left in each `Dockerfile`.
