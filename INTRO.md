All the Dockerfiles I use! Read below for a description of the container you're about to use.

Each container is automatically built and pushed to [https://hub.docker.com/r/cdrage/](https://hub.docker.com/r/cdrage/) upon each commit.

You may also `git clone https://github.com/cdrage/dockerfiles` and build it yourself (`docker build -t username/container .`).

Below is a general overview (with instructions) on each Docker container I use. This is automatically generated from the comments that I have left in each `Dockerfile`.

Open an issue if there's a problem with a container!
